# About the documentation

A high-level overview of [how the AnyCloud documentation is organized](https://documentation.divio.com/) will help you know how to quickly find what you are looking for:

* [Tutorials](tutorials/host-a-node.js-server-on-your-aws-account.md) take you through an Anycloud example. Start here if youâ€™re new to AnyCloud.
* [How-to guides](https://github.com/alantech/anycloud/tree/eb3bf804e2cff8e04e9ef1667d0fe835fdba0b5f/docs/how_to.md) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how AnyCloud works.
* [Topic guides](https://github.com/alantech/anycloud/tree/eb3bf804e2cff8e04e9ef1667d0fe835fdba0b5f/docs/topics.md) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation about the internals of how AnyCloud works.
* [Reference guides](https://github.com/alantech/anycloud/tree/eb3bf804e2cff8e04e9ef1667d0fe835fdba0b5f/docs/reference.md) contains technical reference for built-in APIs and data types, the standard library and opcodes. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
