# .git

The AnyCloud CLI expects your project to be version controlled with `git`. If that is not already the case, simply running the following commands should suffice:

```text
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

It is not required for your repository to be hosted in a remote `git` server like GitHub or GitLab.
