# Project Structure

The AnyCloud CLI expects your project to be version controlled with `git`. However, it is not required for your repository to be hosted in a remote `git` server like GitHub or GitLab. Simply running the following commands should suffice:

```text
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
