# Deploy to Azure

#### Generating Credentials

1. Create an Azure Active Directory application and it's Service Principal as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal). After following the previous instructions you can copy your `Application (client) ID` and your `Directory (tenant) ID`.
2. Create a secret for the service principal created above as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-2-create-a-new-application-secret). Copy the secret `Value` immediately since you will not be able to retrieve it again later.
3. For the subscription ID you can go to your [subscriptions page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) in Azure portal and get the ID.
4. To be able to use Anycloud with Azure you will need to manage your subscription resource provider registration as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-register-resource-provider#solution-3---azure-portal). You will need to register: `Microsoft.Compute`, `Microsoft.Network`, `Microsoft.Storage` and `Microsoft.Security`.
