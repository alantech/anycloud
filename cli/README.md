# Anycloud CLI

The anycloud CLI executable generated by cargo to use anycloud does not need alan. However, building the CLI executable process for anycloud needs the following:

- rust >= 1.49.0
- alan >= 0.1.25 (but [installing](https://github.com/alantech/alan#installation) the [latest](https://github.com/alantech/alan/releases) is recommended)
